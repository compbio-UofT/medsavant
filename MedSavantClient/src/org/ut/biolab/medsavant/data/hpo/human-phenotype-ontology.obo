comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and\napplied inaccurately.

Alternatively, an apparently shortened anteroposterior dimension (length) of the head compared to width." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19125436]
comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms also have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Brachycephaly is distinct from Flat occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately.

def: "Tall head relative to width and length." [pmid:19125436]
comment: Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.

def: "An `abnormality of skull shape` (HP:0002648) characterized by a `increased anterior-posterior diameter` (PATO:0002043), i.e., an increased antero-posterior dimension of the skull. Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19125436]
comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).

comment: Increased convexity of the occiput gives an appearance of prominence. There are no objective measures for convexity of the occiput, and evaluation depends heavily on the experience of the observer. This finding may or may not be accompanied by Dolichocephaly, but this should be coded separately.

comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. In the HPO, following the definition of the World Health Organization, we use the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

Lop ears are usually larger than normal ears. Mild forms are limited to the superior ear, more severe forms affect the superior and posterior ear. The concha may be excessively concave.

comment: The nuchal fold is the skin thickness in the posterior aspect of the fetal neck. The definition of a thickened nuchal fold involves gestational age specific criteria. A measurement of 6 mm or more is considered abnormal between 18 and 24 weeks of gestation and a measurement of 5 mm or more is considered significant at 16 to 18 weeks. A thickened nuchal fold should be distinguished from cystic hygroma, in which the skin in this area has fluid-filled loculations. A thickened nuchal fold should not be confused with nuchal translucency, which is a specific measurement of fluid in the posterior aspect of the neck at 11 to 14 weeks gestation (see practice guidelines at http://www.sogc.org).

comment: The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].

comment: Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

comment: If the kidneys sense reduced renal blood flow, as can happen with reduced blood pressure, they secrete renin into the blood, where it reacts with angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).

comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

def: "The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age." [eMedicine:262679, HPO:probinson]
comment: Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.

comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

Patients with homocystinuria have a clinical phenotype similar to that of patients affected by Marfan syndrome (pectus excavatum, dislocated lenses, etc). This term does not describe the disease entity, but rather the finding of an increased concentration of homocystine in urine, which can be easily detected by a sensitive test for disulphide compounds (the cyanide-nitroprusside reaction) and using chromatographic techniques. Homocystinuria can be caused by biochemical defects including cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocystine methyltransferase deficiency, N5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and methhylcobalamin deficiency.

comment: Hypothalamic hamartoma is a malformation, not a tumor. Hypothalamic hamartomas grow at the rate of, or slower than, the surrounding brain tissue. A hamartoma of the hypothalamus appears as a non-enhancing mass in the floor of the third ventricle posterior to the optic chiasm that is isointense to grey matter on T1 and T2 pulse sequences of an MRI, but may have distinct intensity on FLAIR (neither cranial CT examination nor cranial ultrasound examination is adequate for diagnosis of hypothalamic hamartom). Individuals with hypothalamic hamartomas may have neurologic symptoms, although most are asymptomatic. Removal of the hypothalamic hamartoma is not indicated and often results in iatrogenic pituitary insufficiency.

comment: Patients often describe myotonia as stiffness that is worse at the onset of activity and that improves with repeated muscle contractions. Myotonia tends to worsen in cold weather. Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand.

def: "An impairment of the class-switch recombination process that normally leads B lymphocytes to produce IgG, IgA, or IgE." [HPO:probinson, pmid:11544001]
comment: The generation of the antibody repertoire requires two successive steps. The first is antigen- and T-cell-independent; it takes place in the fetal liver and the bone marrow. Immature B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin-gene variable segments (V segments), diversity segments (D segments) and joining segments (J segments), producing a functionally integrated VDJ segment linked to the mu constant region (C-mu), which determines the primary antibody repertoire composed of IgM antibodies. The second step is antigen- and T-cell-dependent and takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. After encountering antigen, B cells proliferate and form germinal centers. In this unique anatomic formation, two genetic events lead to generation of the secondary antibody repertoire: class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR of immunoglobulins occurs by a recombination process between two different switch regions (S regions) located upstream of each C region. Replacement of C-mu by a constant region of another class of immunoglobulin (C-gamma, C-alpha or C-epsilon) ensues and leads to the production of IgG, IgA or IgE.

Lipofuscin (from the Greek word for fat and the Latin word for dark), refers to intracellular autofluorescent material that accumulates in aging cells with a excitation wavelength between 320 and 480 nm and an emission wavelength between 460 and 630 nm. Lpofuscin consists of a mixture of oxidized proteins and lipids, carbohydrates and trace amount of metals. Ceroid iss a lipofuscin-like lipopigment that arises from pathological conditions such as disease, malnutrition, and cell stress. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase makes up approximately 40% of this lipopigment/ceroid accumulation.

comment: Fragile sites can be defined as heritable specific loci on human chromosomes that exhibit non-random gaps, constrictions or breaks when chromosomes are exposed to specific cell culture conditions. Over 120 different fragile sites have been identified in the human genome. Some of these sites are sensitive to folate, that is, they can be induced by a culture medium deficient in folic acid and thymidine, and hence a medium with lowered levels of dTTP or dCTP, two immediate components of DNA, or by a medium enriched either in methotrexate, an inhibitor of folate metabolism, or in fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthesis. The folate-dependent fragile phenotype occurs if more than a critical number of CCG/CGG repeats are present (e.g., > 230 repeats for FRAXA).

comment: Regitine produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration. In the regitine blocking test, regitine is injected rapidly and bood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. A positive response to the reginitine blocking test is present when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A positive response is suggestive of pheochromocytoma and should generally be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures such as measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites.

comment: Cultured fibroblasts from the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses store higher than normal amounts of glycosaminoglyeans. Histochemical stains such as toluidine blue and Alcian blue can be used to detect such intracellular glycosaminoglycans which, being negatively charged, are bound and precipitated by the cationic dyes. Cultured fibroblasts from homozygotes -and heterozygotes for the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses accumulate excessive quantities of glycosaminoglycans. The cytoplasmic staining with toluidine blue is referred to as metachromasia (pink) and orthochromasia (blue) and that with Alcian blue as alcianophilia.

On histological staining with hematoxylin and eosin, rimmed vacuoles are popcorn-like clear vacuoles with a densely blue rim. The vacuoles are often associated with cytoplasmic and occasionally intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Rimmed vacuoles are characteristic for inclusion-bosy myositis, but are also seen an a number of other diseases. This term implies that rimmed vacuoles are found histologically. In some cases, the majority of muscle fibers are involved, but in others, rimmed vacuoles can be found in only a minority of fibers.

Epiphyseal plates are located at the distal and proximal ends of the long bones, in this case of the radius and premature fusion will have an effect on the growh of the radial bone, inhibiting or at least disturbing the normal growth and development of the bone." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone. The plate is found in children and adolescents; in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an epiphyseal line. The growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement. The growth plate includes a relatively inactive reserve zone at the epiphyseal end, moving distally into a proliferative and then hyper trophic zone and ending with a band of ossifying cartilage (the metaphysis).

Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atypic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex).

comment: The alae nasi are the lateral portions of the nose or the wings of the nostrils, which partly encircle the nostrils (nares). They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a cleft ala nasi, but have a severely Underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. The term coloboma has been replaced because a coloboma is a remnant of a physiologically occurring discontinuity of tissue; the alae nasi do not have such a discontinuity.

comment: Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.

comment: The final kidney position in the renal fossa results from the rotation of the kidney with an orientation of the renal pelvis to the medial and the renal calyces to the lateral. Malrotation of the kidney can lead to orientation of the renal pelvis anteriorly, posteriorly and laterally. In most cases, renal malrotation does not cause any symptoms, but, hydronephrosis or stone formation can be observed as complications of renal malformation.

comment: Persons with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are susceptible to fava bean-induced hemolytic anemia because of the oxidative stress induced by compunds in Fava beans (thought to be vicine and isouramil). The same underlying defect can make affected persons susceptible to hemolysis induced by a number of mediciations.

comment: The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.

comment: Reduced convexity of the occiput gives an appearance of flattening. There are no objective measures for convexity of the occiput, and evaluation depends heavily on the experience of the observer. This finding may or may not be accompanied by Brachycephaly (which should be coded separately), and may be observed more frequently when an infant is placed to sleep on his/her back. Occipital plagiocephaly can result from fusion or sclerosis of the lambdoid suture. If unilateral, this is accompanied by unilateral occipital flattening and bulging of the ispilateral frontal bone.

comment: DIC is a complex syndrome in which there is pathological generation of thrombin and diffuse intravascular clot formation. DIC may occur as acute decompensated or chronic compensated form. In acute decompensated DIC, there is a sudden massive exposure of tissue factor over a brief time period; Intravascular coagulation can also compromise the blood supply to organs and, in conjunction with hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, may contribute to the failure of multiple organs. At the same time, the use and subsequent depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding. Chronic DIC, also known as compensated DIC, results from a persistent weak or intermittent activating stimulus. Under such conditions, destruction and production of coagulation factors and platelets are balanced.

def: "Avascular necrosis of the `proximal epiphysis of the femur` (FMA:32841) occurring in growing children and caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the head of the femur close to the hip joint. The necrosis is characteristically associated with flattening of the femoral head, for which reason the term coxa plana has been used to refer to this feature in the medical literature." [HPO:probinson]
comment: In medical parlance, this is often referred to as Legg Calve Perthes disease. Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh.

comment: On T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the signal intensity of the normal renal cortex is typically higher than medulla, resulting in easily visualized corticomedullary differentiation (CMD). Loss of CMD can be seen in disorders such as glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, end-stage chronic renal failure, obstructive hydronephrosis, and acute allograft rejection.

comment: The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin.

comment: The simultaneous occurrence a low thyroid hormone level and a normal or low serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with hypothyroidism establishes the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is normally synthesized and released by the hypothalamus, enables the physician to distinguish between pituitary and hypothalamic causes of hypothyroidism.\nTRH will normally cause the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus does not synthesize or release TRH, the administration of exogenous TRH will result in prompt rise of serum TSH. To date, the cases reported of pituitary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism, on the other hand, may either be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease.

comment: Renal aminoaciduria is characterized by the abnormally elevated levels of amino acids in the urine, and is usually related to genetic mutations of transport proteins result in the defective reabsorption of free amino acids at the proximal renal tubules. This term does not refer directly to the group of corresponding disease entities but rather to the finding of elevated levels of amino acids in the urine which is inferred to be related to a renal defect rather than to a primary defect of aminoacid metabolism on the basis of other findings.

Usually, pulsatile tinnitus is heard as a lower pitched thumping or booming, a rougher blowing sound which is coincidental with respiration, or as a clicking, higher pitched rhythmic sensation. Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus."

comment: Diaphragmatic paralysis is an extreme form of diaphragmatic weakness. Weakness of the diaphragm can result from abnormalities at any site along its neuromuscular axis, although it most frequently arises from diseases in the phrenic nerves or from myopathies affecting the diaphragm itself. Presence of diaphragmatic weakness may be suspected from the complaint of dyspnea (particularly on exertion) or orthopnea; or the presence of rapid, shallow breathing or, more importantly, paradoxical inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration on physical examination.

They derive from embryonic pluripotent cells and may have various degrees of maturation, according to which they are classified as mature, immature, and malignant. Teratomas are found with decreasing frequency in the ovaries and testis, mediastinum, retroperitoneal space, sacrococcygeal zone, pineal and other intracranial locations.

comment: This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas. This can be distinguished from male pattern baldness as the hairline is the superior boundary of the muscular forehead, which can be actively wrinkled, in contrast to the scalp where no wrinkling can occur. In addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of the skin over the forehead.

comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies considerably among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. If the lower lip vermilion is thin, the inferior border of the vermilion is less curved, and on a profile view, the lower lip vermilion is less convex than usual.

comment: The anterior third of the tongue is usually free or is partially attached to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenulum. There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

comment: A developmental defect resulting in the presence of a thyroglossal cyst, a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. During the embryologic development of the thyroid gland, the precursor of the thyroid migrates from the base of the tongue inferiorly though the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally disappears following the development and migration of the thyroid gland, but if a portion of the duct remain it can form a thyroglossal cyst.

Although the word paralysis is often used interchangeably to mean either complete or partial loss of muscle strength, it is preferable to use paralysis or plegia for complete or severe loss of muscle strength, and paresis for partial or slight loss. Paralysis due to lesions of the principle motor tracts is related to a lesion in the corticospinal, corticobulbar or brainstem descending (subcorticospinal) neurons." [HPO:curators]

comment: Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.

comment: Phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid) is a fatty acid that is derived from chlorophyll and present in the diet. The metabolism of phytanic acid involves alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, which converts phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Peroxisomes involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid. Peroxisomal malfunctioning can lead to over-accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, among other things.

comment: MERGED COMMENT:\nTARGET COMMENT: Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g. brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.\n--------------------\nSOURCE COMMENT: This term will be made obsolete and the annotation files will be updated to reflect mild-to-moderate severity.

Cervical instability mainly involves the upper cervical spine, particularly between C1 and C2. Craniocervical ligaments are the main determinants of cervical spine stability.

name: Mirror image dupliction of digits
namespace: medical_genetics
def: "A mirror-like duplication of the digits of the hands or feet leading to an appearance were radio/ulnar and/or fibular/tibial aspects of the hands and/or feet can not be destinguished anymore. Depending on severity this might also affect the bones of the forarm or lower leg in such a way that there might be two ulnae rather than one radius and ulna each. The same may be seen for the fibula and tibia." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.

comment: During lens terminal differentiation, the originally cuboidal lens vesicle cells elongate into long fiber-like cells, or fibers. Y-shaped sutures form because of how the lens epithelial cells proliferate during formation. The Y sutures demarcate the boundaries between the lens cortex, which is peripheral to the Y sutures, and the lens nucleus, which is within and includes the Y sutures. The anterior Y suture is oriented upright, and the posterior Y suture is inverted.

def: "Blepharochalasis is characterized by recurrent, non-painful, nonerythematous episodes of eyelid edema. It has been divided into hypertrophic and atrophic forms. In the hypertrophic form recurrent edema results in orbital fat herniation through a weakened orbital septum. Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads." [PMID:3207663]
comment: Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads. Most of these atrophic patients do not go through a hypertrophic phase. Multiple attacks of eyelid edema result in thinning, stretching, and atrophy of eyelid tissues. The eyelid skin becomes redundant, discolored, and atrophic, appearing like wrinkled cigarette paper. The upper eyelids are more commonly affected, but the lower eyelids may also be involved. Blepharochalasis is not synonymous with dermatochalasis.

def: "The presence during the prenatal period of a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts near the posterior aspect of the neck. Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm." [emedicine:402757, HPO:probinson]
comment: Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.

comment: Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.

namespace: medical_genetics
def: "A kind of nuclear cataract characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens." [HPO:probinson, pmid:9718335]
comment: This phenotype is characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Some crystals may be 11 mm in length, and their biochemical composition is not known. This type of cataract is considered to be different from the corraliform cataract, which does not show the needlelike projections. This opacity does not appear to respect the sutures or the direction of the lens fibers (Francois 1963) and appears to originate from the fetal and postnatal nuclei, suggesting a congenital origin with some postnatal progression, if any.

comment: Xanthinuria is generally caused by a defect in the xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and can further catalyze the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid. The formation of xanthine stones in the urinary tract is the main evidence of this abnormality.

comment: The medical literautre on amyloidosis is confused with clinical and histochemical designations used when the amyloid disease processes were poorly understood. To be designated an amyloid fibril protein, the protein must occur in tissue deposits and exhibit affinity for Congo red and green birefringence when viewed by polarisation microscopy.

comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.

def: "A type of age-related cataract that primarily affects the nucleus of the lens." [HPO:probinson, pmid:15708105]
comment: As the lens ages, new layers of fibres are added and the lens nucleus is compressed and becomes harder (nuclear sclerosis cataract), with associated yellowing of the lens. Nuclear sclerosis typically progresses slowly.

comment: The cortex of the lens is made of the newest lens fibres. With ageing, discrete opacities can develop within the cortex of the lens that typically cause no visual symptoms unless they involve the visual axis or the entire cortex, in which case the lens becomes white and is said to be mature.

comment: While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. One or more\nepileptic seizures may occur in the context of a brain insult (systemic, toxic, or metabolic). These events (defined acute symptomatic seizures, provoked seizures, or situation-related seizures) are presumed to be an acute\nmanifestation of the insult and may not recur when the underlying cause has been removed or the acute phase\nhas elapsed.

Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology; the conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), schwannomatosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.

comment: An aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland may occur anywhere along the path of initial descent of the thyroid. A total failure to descend contrasts with the incomplete descent of the thyroid, in which case the resulting final resting point of the gland may be high in the neck or just below the hyoid bone. Appart from an abnormal descent, accessory thyroid tissue can also occur, arising from remnants of the thyroglossal duct anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct tract.

def: "A tic is a sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization involving discrete muscle groups." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

comment: Typical sites of involvement are the axillary margins of the scapula, ribs, pubic rami, proximal ends of the femur and ulna. On x-rays pseudo-fractures appear as a lucent line about 1 -2 cm wide, vertical to the cortex and are pathognomonic of osteomalacia, seen on the concave side and are also seen in Paget disease on the convex side of the bone.

comment: A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).

def: "Benign, slow-growing tumors without any metastatic potential. Despite their benign nature, they can damage nearby structures causing organ dysfunction. Histologically they resemble low-grade fibrosarcomas, but they are very locally aggressive and tend to recur even after complete resection. There is a tendency for recurrence in the setting of prior surgery and the most common localisation of these tumors is intraabdominal from smooth muscle cells of the instestine." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with Gardner's syndrome, a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female gender, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history and a history of previous abdominal surgery.

def: "A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound. Also known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, from the Latin singult, the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.

def: "Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the `basal ganglia` (FMA:84013). Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders.

def: "Senile plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid in the gray matter of the brain." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

comment: Hands and feet in one individual might be similarly affected or very diverse and the phenotype is very variable even within families. Penetrance is reduced and some idnividuals have been observed presenting only with unilateral smaller 2nd toe which may be overlooked till a much more severly affected family member is seen.

comment: A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of fibrous connective tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments and fascia as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone, and fascia connect muscles to other muscles. Tendons and muscles work together and can only exert a pulling force.

This aberrant innervation leads to uncontrollable tearing while eating or in anticipation of a meal." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.

def: "`Hemorrhage` (MPATH:119) occurring between the `dura mater` (FMA:9592) and the `arachnoid mater` (FMA:9591)." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Usually resulting from tears in veins that cross the subdural space, subdural hemorrhage may cause an increase in intracranial pressure, which can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Subdural hematomas are often life-threatening when acute, but chronic subdural hematomas are usually not deadly if treated.

comment: Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.

def: "Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.

comment: Esophageal duplication is a rare cause of mediastinal mass. An esophageal duplication may be a simple epithelial cyst or duplication that contains muscle and submucosa but not epithelium. In most cases, the duplication is located in the lower thrid of the esophagus, and the most common associated symptom is difficulty in swallowing. Esophageal duplication occurs because of maldevelopment of the posterior division of embryonic foregut.

comment: Normally, lateral rotation of the tibia increases from approximately 5º at birth to approximately 15º at maturity. Tibial torsion is the most common cause of intoeing. In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.

namespace: medical_genetics
def: "A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.

def: "A serious and potentially life-threatening condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis)." [ISBN:9780781770873]
comment: This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The prime cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death. Diabetes and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene. There are different types of gangrene with different symptoms, such as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangrene, internal gangrene and necrotising fasciitis. Treatment options include debridement (or, in severe cases, amputation) of the affected body parts, antibiotics, vascular surgery, maggot therapy or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

It may cause low back pain, headaches and neurological signs such as weakness and loss of bowel and bladder function, but in many patients it is asymptomatic. It is also a cause of posterior vertebral scalloping present in radiographs in patients who are diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis. Dural ectasia may also manifest in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, cauda equina syndrome and in ankylosing spondylitis.

comment: Lesions in which collagen predominates are called collagenomas; lesions in which elastin predominates are called elastomas. A nevus mucinosis is a lesion in which an alteration in the amount of dermal glycosaminoglycan is present. The name nevus mucinosis is also used for lesions in which an alteration in more than one dermal component is present. Connective tissue nevi may be solitary or multiple, sporadic or inherited. They may occur as isolated skin lesions, or they may be associated with a number of syndromes.

It is thought to be due to laryngeal hypoplasia, floppy epiglottis, small larynx, and asymmetric vocal cords, but is probably also related to dysfunction of the central nervous system. This sign occurs in infants and disappears with age.
